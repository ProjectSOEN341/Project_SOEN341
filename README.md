## Description

Whether youâ€™re collaborating with a team, connecting with a community, or chatting privately with friends, the platform offers an intuitive and organized space to stay connected. Users can create topic-specific channels, share media, and engage in one-on-one conversations, all while enjoying customizable features that enhance the experience. With a clean interface and robust privacy options, the platform is the perfect hub for meaningful and efficient communication.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to succesfully implement all the core features the client requires while also providing a comfortable and interesting website for users to enjoy.

## Core Features
Text Channels for Group Communication
* Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").
* Messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.

Direct Messaging Between Users  
* Users can join a predefined set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").

Role-Based User Permissions
* Two roles: Admin and Member.
* Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones).
* Members can only send and view messages.
